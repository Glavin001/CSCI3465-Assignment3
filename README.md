## Assignment

See http://cs.smu.ca/~jdeveaux/csci/3465/2014/assign3.html

> Develop one (or more) versions of the "fridge magnet" client/server application.
Your fridge (server) contains letters placed randomly on the door.
Your kids (clients) will approach the fridge and be allowed to move some of the letters.
Multiple kids can move letters on the fridge (although not necessarily the same letter) simultaneously
When one kid moves a letter, all of the other kids will see that letter move, in real time
When a kid leaves the fridge, the fridge doesn't fall to pieces (graceful connection termination)

> This assignment is meant to be written in a client/server style as a variation of the Observer pattern as demonstrated in the ChatClient/ChatServer programs.

> At the very least, you must implement this application using Sockets to establish the client/server connection.
Bonus marks will be awarded for including a version where the client and server communicate with each other using RMI or SocketChannels

> Provide DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS on how to get the client and server to communicate to each other:
> - On the same machine
> - On separate machines

> Be sure to include your name in the corner of your frame! 

> Notes:
> Your assignments will be marked based on the effectiveness of your solution, as well as the way your make use of classes and interfaces in your solution.
